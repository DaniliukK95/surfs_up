# Surfs_Up
Module 9 – Challenge – Deliverable 3

## Overview of the Analysis

### Purpose
In this module, we are trying to recruit W. Avy and his team to invest in our idea of a surf and ice cream shop in Hawaii. Because of his experience with the weather, he is skeptical. In the module portion before the challenge, we analyzed the weather data provided by W. Avy to give everyone insight about the precipitation and temperature in Oahu. We analyzed and got results using Python code in Jupyter notebook. We also learned and utilized more tools like SQLite, SQLAlchemy and Flask to create an app for the team of investors. For the challenge analysis, we were asked to gather data on temperature trends for the months of June and December to see sustainability of the shop year-round. 

## Results
The images below show the June and December temperature statistics we obtained from the two analysis deliverables in this challenge.

![December_temps](https://github.com/DaniliukK95/surfs_up/blob/main/resources/december_temps.png)

- As shown from the statistics, the average temperature for these months are 75 degrees for June and 71 degrees December. 

- The minimum temperature does fall quite a bit in December (56 degrees) compared to June’s 64 degrees. 

- The maximum temperature for these months is actually very high. June came in with a maximum of 85 degrees and December with a maximum of 83 degrees. 

## Summary
With the mean temperature shown previously, on average the temperature is still warm to both get ice cream and surf year-round which is supports our business idea. One concerning aspect is the minimum temperatures shown previously. This could be slightly troublesome for both aspects of the shop as its less likely to surf or consume ice cream in colder weather. Of course, this is not the average temperature so it could only be a few days of the month. But looking at the maximum temperature brings some promise back to the business. With the maximum temperature recorded in the 80’s, this is good news for the shop. This goes to show that there might be some cold days but also some hot days to make up for it. Overall, it looks like these months will not impose a huge problem for the shop. Compared to the hotter months, the colder times of the year might have business slowed down on some instances, but not for the majority. 

### Two additional queries

![December_precip](https://github.com/DaniliukK95/surfs_up/blob/main/resources/december_precip.png)

I created an analysis for the statistics of the precipitation that occurs in these two months. I feel that this information will be useful since rainy days or even seasons can draw less tourism and less activity. People may be less inclined to go outside of their houses or travel to Hawaii when it is known to be raining. From the images above, we can see that December does have a higher average for precipitation (0.21). This might impose issues for the months close to this range.
